Usage:
compile the driver and miniGit.cpp into a .out and run the program in the directory you want to turn into a repo.
The command prompt will display all the information needed to use the program. After intializing the repo,
the ability to add files, remove files, commit versions, and checkout previous versions will become available 
to use. 

Phase 1 has no memory of previous repos in the directory, so the exit command will completely wipe the .minigit
and leave you with whatever commit you were checking out.
